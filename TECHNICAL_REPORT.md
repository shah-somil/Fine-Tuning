- Provide comprehensive evaluation and error analysis
- Create a production-ready inference pipeline

### 1.3 Contributions

- Novel application of weighted training for multi-source financial data
- Comprehensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
- Detailed error analysis with actionable improvement recommendations
- Production-ready model with complete deployment artifacts

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Financial NLP

Financial natural language processing has gained significant attention due to the unique challenges of financial text, including:
- Domain-specific terminology and jargon
- Temporal dependencies and forward-looking statements
- Regulatory language and compliance requirements
- Market sentiment indicators and economic indicators

### 2.2 Pre-trained Language Models

The success of BERT and its variants has revolutionized NLP tasks. For financial applications, domain-specific models like FinBERT have shown superior performance compared to generic models.

### 2.3 Fine-tuning Strategies

Recent work has focused on:
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, AdaLoRA)
- Multi-task learning for financial NLP
- Few-shot learning for domain adaptation

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset Preparation

#### 3.1.1 Data Sources
The dataset consists of financial text samples from multiple sources with varying levels of annotator agreement:
- **AllAgree**: 100% annotator agreement (highest quality)
- **75Agree**: 75% annotator agreement
- **66Agree**: 66% annotator agreement  
- **50Agree**: 50% annotator agreement (lowest quality)

#### 3.1.2 Data Cleaning Strategy
```python
# Quality prioritization mapping
priority_map = {
    "allagree": 1,  # highest priority
    "75agree": 2,
    "66agree": 3,
    "50agree": 4   # lowest priority
}

# Deduplication with quality preservation
df = df.sort_values(by="priority", ascending=True)
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=["text"], keep="first")
```

#### 3.1.3 Data Splitting
- **Gold Test Set**: 15% of AllAgree data (highest quality)
- **Training/Validation**: Remaining data with 70/15 split
- **Leakage Prevention**: Explicit removal of test samples from training data

#### 3.1.4 Sample Weighting
Implemented quality-based sample weighting to prioritize high-quality annotations:
```python
agree_weight = {
    "allagree": 1.0, 
    "75agree": 0.7, 
    "66agree": 0.5, 
    "50agree": 0.3

```
Confusion Matrix (Test Set):
                Predicted
Actual    Negative  Neutral  Positive
Negative     45       2        1
Neutral       1      287       3

```

### 4.2 Hyperparameter Optimization Results

#### 4.2.1 Best Configuration
- **Learning Rate**: 3e-5
- **Epochs**: 3
- **Warmup Ratio**: 0.0
- **Test F1-Macro**: 0.968030 (HPO-tuned FinBERT)
- **Test Accuracy**: 97.9%

#### 4.2.2 HPO Analysis
The hyperparameter search revealed:
- Learning rate of 3e-5 provided optimal balance between convergence speed and stability
- 3 epochs were sufficient with early stopping preventing overfitting
- No warmup provided slightly better performance for this specific task
- **Key Finding**: Fine-tuning on noisy S3_max data resulted in slightly lower performance than zero-shot FinBERT on clean test data, highlighting the importance of data quality alignment

### 4.3 Error Analysis

#### 4.3.1 Error Categories
Analysis of misclassified samples revealed primary error patterns:

1. **Directionality Context** (40% of errors)
   - Example: "Unit costs fell by 6.4%" → Predicted: Negative, Actual: Positive
   - Issue: Model associates "fell" with negative sentiment, missing cost reduction context

2. **Financial Jargon** (30% of errors)
   - Example: "Pre-tax loss totaled EUR 0.3 mn" → Predicted: Negative, Actual: Positive
   - Issue: Over-indexing on "loss" without considering comparative context

3. **Negation Context** (20% of errors)
   - Example: "Not a significant concern" → Predicted: Negative, Actual: Neutral
   - Issue: Difficulty with negation and double negatives

4. **Forward-looking Statements** (10% of errors)
   - Example: "May see improvement in Q4" → Predicted: Positive, Actual: Neutral
   - Issue: Uncertainty markers not properly weighted

#### 4.3.2 Improvement Recommendations
1. **Data Augmentation**: Create synthetic examples for directionality contexts
2. **Domain-specific Preprocessing**: Enhanced financial term recognition
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple model predictions
4. **Active Learning**: Iterative improvement with human feedback
